Research Methodology
====================

## Idea

 - Parcels are emitting a radio signal with a fixed radius
 - DeliveryTrucks are emitting a radio signal as well with the same fixed radius
 - When a truck picks up a radio signal from a parcel. it picks up the parcel
 - When a truck picks up a radio signal from another truck, they meet and exchange parcels based on their current path
 - When a truck has no parcels left, they navigate randomly

## Cost Functions

 - Verbeteren met uitwisselen paketten

## Objectives

 - Relatie tussen radius en communicatie
 - Relatie tussen communcatie trucks
