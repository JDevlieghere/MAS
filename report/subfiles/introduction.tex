This research paper will describe a pick up delivery problem and a Multi-Agent solution to it.
For easy comparison with Genreau et al. we will be using their dataset.
Since their dataset uses specifice coordinates we will be using an empty plane instead of a road map as the area on which the delivery trucks drive.

In our paper parcels are discovered by a radio signal they emit as soon as they are available for pickup.
Every truck in range gets to bid in an auction for the parcel. 
If there is only a single truck within range it recieves the pickup task automatically and instantly.
Initally as soon as the auction is complete the truck that recieved the task is blindly commited to this task. 

As an extention we will look at the case in which trucks that are in eachother neighborhood can reauction their given tasks to improve both their schedules.
This can be seen as more open-minded commitment in which the opportunity of being near another truck can be used to reschdule the task and become a more efficient solution.
