This research paper describes a multi-agent approach for a dynamic pick-up and deliver problem. The problem consists of pick-ups and deliveries that have a given time window wherein the parcel is required to be picked up and delivered respectively.
\\\\
To allow for a multi-agent solution, beacons are introduced into the environment. Both trucks and parcels are fitted with a beacon. Once a parcel becomes available for pickup, its beacon is enabled. When the radius of a truck's beacon overlaps with the radius of a parcel's beacon, the truck detects the parcel. This is the only way a parcel can be intercepted by a delivery truck. Using an auction, the parcel is assigned to a truck. The problem consists of (1) assigning the parcel to a proper truck, i.e. one that can deliver the parcel within its time window and (2) scheduling deliveries so that the parcel's delivery deadlines are met.
