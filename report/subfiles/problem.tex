The problem is based on the dynamic pick-up and deliver problem. Both pick-ups and deliveries have a given time window wherein the parcel should be picked up or delivered respectively. Once a parcel becomes available for pickup, a beacon is enabled. When the radius of a truck's beacon overlaps with the radius of a parcel's beacon, the truck is able to detect the parcel. This is the only way a parcel can be detected by a delivery truck. Using an auction the parcel is assigned to a truck. The problem consists of (1) assigning the parcel to a proper truck, i.e. one that can deliver the parcel within its time window and (2) scheduling deliveries so that the parcel's delivery deadlines are met.
