We can conclude that a multi-agent system is a valid approach for a dynamic pick-up and delivery problem. We have determined the optimal beacon range for our experimental setup to be 750 meters. Unfortunately, the results did not allow to determine whether exchanging parcels improved the solution. However we expect that with a few improvements to the current naive algorithm, exchanging parcels would be beneficial. The same goes for the current delivery strategies which all yield very similar results.
