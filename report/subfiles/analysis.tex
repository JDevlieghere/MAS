\subsubsection{Extending the beacon radius reduces the total cost.}
Under the assumption that more information would mean that agents would be able to better respond to this we assumed that increasing the beacon radius would yield better results.
This doesn't seem to be the case increasing the radius from 0.1 up to 0.75 does however yield better results.
But since we found 0.75 to be the optimal radius we reject the hypothesis.

\subsubsection{Exchanging parcels reduces the total cost.}
We can't really make a statement about rejecting or accepting this hypothesis.
The data we collected is ambiguous so neither would be appropriate.

\subsubsection{NearestOnTimeDeliveryStrategy is the most cost efficient.}
The data we collected seems to be consistent about this.
Of course there are a few outliers in our test but these are very sparse.
Therefore we do not reject the hypothesis.
