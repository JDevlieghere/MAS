This section compares the choices made in our multi-agent design with other approaches used in existing multi-agent systems.

\subsubsection{Communication \& Negotiation}
New parcels are auctioned by the truck first detecting its beacon using a first-price sealed-bid auction. Because the bid placed by an agent is determined by its capacity, which is assumed to remain unchanged throughout the bidding process, there is no advantage in using ascending or descending auctions such as an English or Dutch auction. As a consequence there is no point in using an open-cry protocol since agents aren't going to change their bids based on bids by their peers.
